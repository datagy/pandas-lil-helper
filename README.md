# Pandas' lil helper

*Pandas' lil helper* provides a number of helpful tools to make Python's Pandas extension a lil' bit easier.

## Features

### Reassign Columns

Easily reassign Pandas columns using *ra*. You can name your dataframe (which defaults to *df*) and the column.

### Filter Pandas Dataframes

Use this to filter your Pandas dataframes (with 1, 2, or 3 conditions). You can name your dataframe, select different amounts of conditions, and different boolean expressions.

To create different numbers of conditions, use:
* *cond1*: 1 condition, 
* *cond2*: 2 conditions,
* *cond3*: 3 conditions.
