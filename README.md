# Pandas' lil helper README

*Pandas' lil helper* provides a number of helpful tools to make Python's Pandas extension a lil' bit easier.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

These would be pretty useless without Pandas, so I'd recommend using Pandas!

## Known Issues

Let me know if you run into any issues!

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0
